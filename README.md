# Transform Desktop App
Rust/TypeScript based application that allows the user to transform .PNG images to the .WEBP format.
## File Explorer
In order to improve user experience, i've added a feature that serves as a basic file explorer to navigate your way in search of .PNG images you may want to convert.
## Quality
Quality of result image (.WEBP) can be stated in the settings option. It defaults at start to 75.0
## Output
Images converted will have the exact same name as the original images EXCEPT the file format will be .webp instead of .png.
Additionally the output path for all converted images will be the same folder/path the original image has.
